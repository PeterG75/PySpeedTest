# Python Internet Speed Test

This is a small, lightweight utility that tests the Internet connection at set intervals.  I wrote it to prove to the people who manage my Internet that it's ***really*** bad.  It takes periodic (or not-so-periodic) samples of your Internet speed.  Statistics recorded are upload speed, download speed, ping time, and if something fails reason for failure.  

## Quick start

Download the executable from [here][0], put it somewhere you'll remember, run it and click the `Start` button.  If you want to make my life a bit better, before you click start, type in the `Location` field where you are (be descriptive, but brief.  For example, here, I write "McVey 3rd north", not "404 Stanford Road, Grand Forks, ND 58202 ...").  After a little while, click the `Stop` button, and then the `Upload` button.  Repeat until you don't want to anymore.

## Configuration
If you want to change your settings, launch the program and click the `Edit Configuration` button.  This will spawn a pop-up window with empty fields (working on it!). Click `Refresh` in the top right corner to populate the fields with the current values.  Edit as you wish, then click `Apply`.
