# Getting Started

## Downloads

First, I would recommend downloading the program.  That typically makes it a bit easier to run.  Download it on [this page](downloads).

For Windows, you should download the `.exe` file.  For OSx/Linux, you can download the source tarball in either `.tar.gz` or `.zip`, whichever is easier for you.  On Linux, that is probably `.tar.gz`; on OSx, I have no idea (if you do, please let me know.  I only have access to a Windows laptop).

## Running

On Windows, simply double-click the `.exe` file you downloaded.  It will automatically create a file called `config.ini` containing various configuration details; ignore this unless you want to change your default preferences.

On OSx/Linux, which come by default with Python, navigate to the downloaded source and unzip it.
