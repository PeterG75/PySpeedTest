# PySpeedTest

This is a small, lightweight utility that tests the Internet connection at set intervals. I wrote it to prove to the people who manage my Internet that it's really bad. It takes periodic (or not-so-periodic) samples of your Internet speed. Statistics recorded are upload speed, download speed, ping time, and if something fails reason for failure.
