# PySpeedTest

This is a small, lightweight utility that tests the Internet connection at set intervals. I wrote it specifically for University of North Dakota to prove to ResNet that the internet in my dorm is **real bad**.  As part of the project and that I hope to distribute it to the rest of the dorm, I figured I should probably write documentation, so here it is.
